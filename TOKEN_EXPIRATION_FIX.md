# Token Expiration Redirect Fix

## Problem Description
When accessing the app with an expired token, users would see the dashboard briefly (for a few seconds) before being redirected to the login page. This created a poor user experience with:
- Brief flash of dashboard content
- Delayed redirect (3.2 seconds)
- Unnecessary API calls with expired tokens
- Race conditions between auth check and component rendering

## Root Causes

1. **PrivateRoute Only Checked Token Existence**
   - Only verified `localStorage.getItem('access_token') !== null`
   - Did not validate if the token was actually valid or expired
   - Allowed access to protected routes with expired tokens

2. **No Token Validation Before Route Access**
   - Dashboard and other components started loading immediately
   - Made API calls before auth validation completed
   - API interceptor caught 401 errors reactively instead of proactively

3. **Delayed Redirect**
   - 3.2 second timeout before redirecting to login
   - Created visible delay and poor UX

4. **Asynchronous Permission Loading**
   - PermissionContext loaded in parallel with components
   - Created race condition between auth check and rendering

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced PrivateRoute Component (`PrivateRoute.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Added async token validation using `checkAuthentication()`
- Implemented loading state with spinner during auth check
- Validates token with backend before allowing route access
- Clears all auth data if token is invalid
- Prevents flash of unauthorized content

**Benefits:**
- No more brief dashboard display with expired tokens
- Proper loading state provides better UX
- Auth validation happens before any component rendering
- Comprehensive cleanup of auth data on failure

### 2. Client-Side Token Validation Utilities (`utils/tokenValidation.ts`)
**New File Created with:**
- `decodeToken()` - Decodes JWT without verification (client-side check only)
- `isTokenExpired()` - Checks if token is expired
- `getTokenTimeToExpire()` - Returns time until expiration
- `shouldRefreshToken()` - Determines if token needs proactive refresh (< 2 min)
- `clearAuthData()` - Centralized function to clear all auth data

**Benefits:**
- Client-side token validation before making API calls
- Proactive token refresh logic
- Consistent auth data cleanup
- Reduces unnecessary API requests with expired tokens

### 3. Improved API Interceptor (`services/api/config.ts`)
**Changes:**
- Imported token validation utilities
- Added check for expired tokens before request
- Attempts token refresh if expired before making request
- Reduced redirect delay from 3.2s to 0.5s
- Added check to prevent redirect loop if already on login page
- Clears user permissions and role data on auth failure

**Benefits:**
- Proactive token refresh prevents 401 errors
- Faster redirect on session expiration
- Prevents multiple redirects
- Complete cleanup of auth state

### 4. Updated Login Component (`Login.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Imported `isTokenExpired` utility
- Validates token on mount, not just checks existence
- Clears expired tokens automatically
- Only redirects if token is valid

**Benefits:**
- Prevents redirect loop with expired tokens
- Cleans up stale auth data
- Better handling of edge cases

### 5. PermissionContext Loading Fix (`context/PermissionContext.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- Added `setLoading(false)` in the no-token path
- Ensures loading state is properly cleared

**Benefits:**
- Prevents infinite loading states
- More reliable permission loading

### 6. Faster Auth Check Timeout (`services/api/auth.api.ts`)
**Changes:**
- Reduced timeout from 5000ms to 3000ms

**Benefits:**
- Faster failure detection
- Improved user experience with quicker redirects

## User Flow After Fix

### Scenario 1: Valid Token
```
User visits app → PrivateRoute validates token → Token is valid 
→ Dashboard renders → User sees dashboard
```
**Time:** ~500ms (auth check)

### Scenario 2: Expired Token
```
User visits app → PrivateRoute validates token → Token expired 
→ Show loading spinner → Clear auth data → Redirect to login
```
**Time:** ~500-1000ms (no flash of dashboard)

### Scenario 3: No Token
```
User visits app → PrivateRoute checks localStorage → No token 
→ Immediate redirect to login
```
**Time:** <100ms (instant redirect)

## Technical Details

### Token Expiration Check
- JWT tokens are decoded client-side to check `exp` claim
- Expiration time is compared with current time
- Tokens expiring within 2 minutes trigger proactive refresh
- Expired tokens are caught before making API requests

### Request Flow
1. User makes request
2. Request interceptor checks token status
3. If expired: Attempt refresh, then proceed
4. If refresh fails: Clear data and redirect
5. If valid: Add to Authorization header

### Response Flow
1. API returns response
2. If 401: Attempt token refresh
3. If refresh succeeds: Retry original request
4. If refresh fails: Clear data, show toast, redirect (500ms delay)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Access app with valid token → Should load normally
- [ ] Access app with expired token → Should redirect to login without showing dashboard
- [ ] Access app without token → Should immediately redirect to login
- [ ] Let token expire during session → Should refresh automatically
- [ ] Make API call with expired token → Should refresh and retry
- [ ] Refresh token fails → Should redirect to login with toast message
- [ ] Login with new credentials → Should work normally
- [ ] Logout → Should clear all data and redirect to login

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/PrivateRoute.tsx` - Enhanced auth validation
2. `frontend/src/services/api/config.ts` - Improved interceptors
3. `frontend/src/services/api/auth.api.ts` - Faster timeout
4. `frontend/src/components/Login.tsx` - Token validation on mount
5. `frontend/src/context/PermissionContext.tsx` - Loading state fix
6. `frontend/src/utils/tokenValidation.ts` - **NEW** Token utilities

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible with existing auth flow
- All changes are improvements to existing logic
- No API changes required
- No database changes required

## Future Improvements

1. Add refresh token rotation for enhanced security
2. Implement token blacklisting on logout
3. Add session management dashboard for users
4. Consider WebSocket for real-time token invalidation
5. Add metrics/logging for auth failures
